# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.3.0] - [Current Date]

### Removed
- Removed vestigial cache system (was never actually used - tooltip path bypassed it)
- Removed `/valuate cache` and `/valuate clearcache` commands
- Removed cache size setting from UI

### Notes
- Cache was architecturally unused: the main tooltip path (GetStatsFromDisplayedTooltip) 
  never touched the cache. Only GetStatsForItemLink used it, which was only called 
  from the /valuate test command. Removed to clean up dead code.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- Stat parsing system with regex patterns
- Tooltip integration for displaying item scores
- Scale system for stat weights
- Configuration UI

### Changed
- Improved slash command help menu

## [0.1.0] - [Initial Release]

### Added
- Initial addon structure
- Basic loading and initialization
- Slash command handler (/valuate, /val)
- Version info command
- Documentation structure (README, CHANGELOG, DEVELOPER, ASCENSION_DEV)
