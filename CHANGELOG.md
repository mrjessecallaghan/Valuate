All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Per-Character Profile System**: Settings and scales are now saved per-character instead of account-wide
  - Each character maintains their own independent set of stat weight scales
  - All settings (UI position, minimap button, decimal places, etc.) are now character-specific
  - Characters no longer share configurations - complete isolation per character
- Added accessor functions for clean per-character data access:
  - `Valuate:GetCharacterKey()` - Returns unique character identifier
  - `Valuate:GetOptions()` - Returns character-specific options
  - `Valuate:GetScales()` - Returns character-specific scales
- Automatic migration system for transitioning from account-wide to per-character storage

### Changed
- Migrated from `SavedVariables` to `SavedVariablesPerCharacter` for data storage
- Updated all 214+ references throughout codebase to use new accessor functions
- Settings now persist per-character across logins and reloads

### Breaking Changes
- **IMPORTANT**: Existing configurations will not automatically transfer to all characters
  - Upon updating to 0.7.0, each character starts with a fresh configuration
  - Use the import/export feature to share scales between your characters if desired
  - Old account-wide saved variables file can be manually deleted after upgrade

### Migration Notes
- To clean up old data, delete: `WTF-Account\[account]\SavedVariables\Valuate.lua` (account-wide file)
- New per-character files are stored at: `WTF-Account\[account]\[realm]\[character]\SavedVariables\Valuate.lua`

## [0.6.2] - 2025-12-XX

### Removed
- Removed vestigial cache system (was never actually used - tooltip path bypassed it)
- Removed `/valuate cache` and `/valuate clearcache` commands
- Removed cache size setting from UI

### Notes
- Cache was architecturally unused: the main tooltip path (GetStatsFromDisplayedTooltip) 
  never touched the cache. Only GetStatsForItemLink used it, which was only called 
  from the /valuate test command. Removed to clean up dead code.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- Stat parsing system with regex patterns
- Tooltip integration for displaying item scores
- Scale system for stat weights
- Configuration UI

### Changed
- Improved slash command help menu

## [0.1.0] - [Initial Release]

### Added
- Initial addon structure
- Basic loading and initialization
- Slash command handler (/valuate, /val)
- Version info command
- Documentation structure (README, CHANGELOG, DEVELOPER, ASCENSION_DEV)
